enjoying it okay we have made it out and

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,360
about and we are determined to make the

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
most of being in Shaman and that means

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
not just being in our hotel room so that

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,799
leaves us with just today 24 hours in

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,640
Sharman to just discover as much as we

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,840
possibly can and the first stop is we're

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,399
going to try and get the ferry to go

41
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,159
Lang Yu Island I hope I pronounced that

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,799
right let's give this translator I go I

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,799
literally cannot read any of the signs I

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,920
don't know anything I know nothing about

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,360
the prir what time the next thing is

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,239
what how much it is it wasn't available

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,680
online to work out so it's down to me

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,120
and the translator to work out if it's

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080
affordable to get over there and if

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,840
we're able to get back in the same day

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,040
when is the last Fair back

52
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840

get over there about Â£30 for all of us I

59
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,680
don't think that's a r return ticket so

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,599
we will have to get a return ticket to

61
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,560

they're all on tours um so it must be a

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
very popular Island for tourists but

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,720
we're kind of now been sucked up into a

115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,479

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,520

159
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,599
cream bun um it looks like that it's

164
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,680
like used by milk from gangu I think um

165
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,879
I don't know or or cream from gangu I

166
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,080
don't know I'm going to try it cuz it

167
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,639
smells delicious is it nice

168
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,280
[Music]

169
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,919
yeah so so good I never thing that's

170
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
really quite different whilst being here

171
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
is these small streets most of the

172
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
streets are about this width which means

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
there's absolutely no chance of getting

174
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,680
a vehicle down here there's no scooters

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
there's no cars I can't hear any

176
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
Vehicles going past I can hear some

177
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
Drilling in the background but other

178
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,879
than that these streets are just

179
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,919
pedestrianized and I think it is

180
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,919
actually by law there isn't allowed to

181
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
be any petrol or diesel engines on this

182
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
island which is quite incredible but

183
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
it's so nice and peaceful and just look

184
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,049
at these streets they're like

185
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,958
[Music]

186
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,479
Alleyways okay I see a beach right there

187
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,159
it says there a beach and it must be

188
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,440
this way let's

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,810
go here we are I think I see a

190
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:57,329
[Music]

191
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,620
beach

192
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,240
[Music]

193
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,399
photographs been taken right now okay so

194
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,160
I think it's time to head back now to

195
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,120
the port and get the ferry back to

196
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
Shaman um it's been a really nice

197
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
experience on here it's definitely a lot

198
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
of a different feel um there has been

199
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,839
like a lot of colonization here in the

200
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,320
past so there's lots of different types

201
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,839
of buildings Western types of influence

202
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,440
here so is a very different feel than

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
the other part of Shaman and other parts

204
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,920
of China my actual big camera battery

205
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,839
has just died and I don't have a spare

206
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,360
one so it's not gone to plan so I'm

207
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,920
currently filming on my phone now it

208
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,120
definitely is worth a visit coming here

209
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
and checking out this place um but we

210
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
better head back to the port now get the

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,200
ferry back and head back to

212
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,079
Shaman okay we were almost late for the

213
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,959
ferry again but we've made it the queue

214
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,600
is all there and the views from here of

215
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
the Shan Skyline look really really good

216
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
so I'm looking forward to seeing what it

217
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,959
looks like from the fer when we're going

218
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,440
back but we've made it in time pH it's

219
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,120
very different from when we came from

220
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Shaman over to the island we're on a

221
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,839
nice Ferry now we're on a barge boat and

222
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,000
he's very very busy um but like I said

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,880
the skyline is pretty special but he's

224
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,600
so busy on here so so

225
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,279
busy okay yeah all good yeah on

226
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,040
unfortunately our trip here in Shaman

227
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,560
hasn't been as smooth as what we wanted

228
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,680
it to be we've been onwell for like four

229
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,440
or 5 days and we haven't seen as much as

230
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
we wanted I'm sure um if we come back

231
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
we'll manage to get out and see it

232
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,440
properly um so we're sorry if we haven't

233
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,000
managed to see this place like we wanted

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
to do um it's such a shame but what we

235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,399
have seen we've really really enjoyed

236
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,079

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,120
tell you what it's not brand new or

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,199
perfectly clean like in Tokyo or South

157
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,639
Korea where we were really amazed but

158
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
it's like a huge step above something

159
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,199
like New York or something it's quite

160
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,479
clean in here yes and I guess we're

161
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
above ground right now on a bridge I

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,599

186
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
people were actually sitting on the

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
floor so overall it was a good first

188
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,240
impression of Shanghai but what I can

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,640
tell you is shanghai's Metro here is

190
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,160
clearly light years ahead of the one in

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,079
Toronto because it's clean and it's

192
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,440
quiet and it looks like it's been uh

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
organized and maintained a lot better

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
than the one in uh my city so anyway

195
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,480
let's get up to the ground upstairs and

196
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,880
let's get

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,120
outside and so we are looking for exit

198
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,760
19 which I guess indicates that right

199
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,360
now there are a lot of ways to walk and

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
there should be a pretty elaborate Maze

201
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,480
of tunnels down here because I guess

202
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,600
there are 19 exits or at least 19

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,279
exits excuse me I look for exit

204
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
19 uh go straight ahead near right go up

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,480
thank you by Pleasure okay very

206
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,839
helpful exit

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,880
2 exit 5 and 19 got it and I tell you

208
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
what Ivana noticed the fashion sense of

209
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
the people here is very familiar and

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
almost the same as what we have in

211
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
Toronto maybe we might wear this style

212
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
of winter clothes like a month earlier

213
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,320
cuz we're a little colder but uh the

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
outfits are the same as if you walk

215
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,720
through Toronto or somewhere and so I'm

216
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,639
led to believe although I'm not even

217
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,240
sure but I think this is all still

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
underground yeah I think those are

219
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
windows up there in the top corner I

220
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
think we're still underground but a huge

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,720
almost like a City Beneath the city

222
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,880
no okay let's see if we do this

223
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,200
right oh insert insert because he going

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,079
to not give it back oh

225
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,720
yeah all right it's time for our first

226
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,360

227
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,519
are come out right in front of this huge

230
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,040
building which I guess is looks like a

231
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,720
mall it say it's called New World

232
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,399

pretty wow the feeling I'm having now is

243
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
similar to the feeling when we started

244
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,680
traveling right and I was amazed by

245
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,519
everything that's so curious It's a real

246
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,320
shame we only got 144 hours but I think

247
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,040
every minute we're going to be busy I

248
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
think so to be honest I just fell asleep

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,480
on the train on the way here but I'm

250
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,120

cannot rest cannot rest exp I only I

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
only got 2 hours of sleep on the plane

253
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,880
on a plane not the best we'll make it

254
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,680
through the day because we have to jet

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,399
can't believe we're here to be honest I

261
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,920
was a little bit nervous if we were

262
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,519
going to get in because I heard online

263
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,839
that if you have a Turkish stab they

264
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,040
might reject you but I'm so glad that

265
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,880
we're here look at this and so I tell

266
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,720
you what this is sort of what I expected

267
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
when I thought of Shanghai if you look

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,680
around it's really really clean all the

269
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,040

275
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,880
uh I'm walking around with a big smile

276
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,639
on my face this is sort of what I

277
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,079
expected and it is not

278
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,480

this is typically Chinese or if this is

326
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,120
just at McDonald's it's called nighty

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,959
nighty and we had to pay a lot extra

328
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,839
ordering it from the counter yeah bit of

329
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,720

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,670
there so $5 each Canadian five Canadian

331
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,399
[Music]

332
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,600
each it's pretty good

333
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,360
actually this just like a lot

334
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
but it's weak and strong it's like an

335
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,480
espresso latte oh it's good cheers oh I

336
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,639

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,560
it's about $3 something Canadian three

343
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,600

wow all right so just like that Ivana

466
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
and I have become completely lost and

467
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,720
here's why according to the real life

468
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,159
signs we see in front of us we are at

469
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,640
the corner of who UB and XU Jang Road XU

470
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,120
Jang is going this way and U is going

471
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,080
that way right now according to the map

472
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,880
on our phone we are at the corner of

473
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,080
lehu and

474
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,520
Nang which is in fact nowhere near where

475
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,720
we think we are because over here is

476
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,679
yuang and hub this corner here will we

477
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,480
ever find our accommodation for today so

478
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,679

479
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,200
life where way over here see U and XU

480
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,720

482
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,880

walking into a meat fing plant

562
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,240
to be honest this is the cheapest place

563
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,039
I

564
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,519
found accommodation is not that cheap

565
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,120
here in Shanghai so yeah let's go up I

566
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,880
see a map there all right so the

567
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,440
check-in process has been

568
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,919
complete and we are going towards our

569
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,279
room this is a hotel although it kind of

570
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,320
functions like a hostel there is a

571
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,640
shared area downstairs that I can show

572
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,279

573
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,039
rooms with shared bathrooms but we've

574
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,080
got a private room let's check it

576
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,080
bathroom over here does the

577
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,200
job bathroom actually looks quite good

578
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,440
to be honest brand new really and uh as

579
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,799
long as there might be a desk for me to

580
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,720
potentially do some work not really so

581
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960

582
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,799

streets again and so here's the lobby of

594
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
our place I will have to talk loudly as

595
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,000

596
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,640

joke pretty great full of people bunch

603
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,039
of laptops I'm sure a bunch of

604
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,320
interesting tourists who are doing their

605
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,279
thing and uh getting their work done as

606
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,399

607
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:55,559
coffee break and then back into the

608
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,340
streets

609
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,410
[Music]

610
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,279
I think they've turned an old phone

611
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,559
booth into a Wi-Fi

612
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,320
Booth that's a good idea

613
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,919
actually oh check it out I think we've

614
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,159
made it to what has to be the main strip

615
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,799
here in Shanghai the pathway is huge on

616
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,000
both sides of me the stores are

617
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,360
incredibly lit up and very interesting

618
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,679
and the buildings above the stores they

619
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:27,919
look so

620
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,760
imposing and so formidable like these

621
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Big Brand buildings kind of overlooking

622
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,000
the walkway here and people all around

623
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,840
not a piece of garbage Insight feels

624
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,919
like I'm in a dream or something feel

625
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,559
like I'm in a movie set or something

626
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,840
exactly am I really walking down the

627
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,919
street in Shanghai uh something

628
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,399
interesting is happening so let's go to

629
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,279
find some food maybe can be our first uh

630
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,399
our first goal wow something nice

631
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,440
 down here what the future looks

632
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,279
like in most

633
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
country

634
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,599
[Music]

635
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,080
wow look at the skyline here something

636
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,360
about the lighting I think it's like

637
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,679
some Haze maybe some Smog or something

638
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,039
doesn't look real looks like somebody

639
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,639
painted it

640
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:23,639
there it's so tripping me out it's so

641
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:26,159
interesting to look at Iana says it's

642
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,399
like looking at the future

643
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,799
wow and stay tuned to our Channel

644
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,440
because in the coming days we'll go

645
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,320
inside this unique one the bottom of it

646
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,919
is a museum and up the top of it is a TV

647
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,639
tower something like this so we'll go

648
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:40,799
check out uh the buildings on this side

649
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,799
of the street in upcoming Vlogs but to

650
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,720
stand here and admire is something

651
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,880
wow it doesn't even look

652
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,399
real I tell you what I can't believe how

653
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,919
there's something like 40 million people

654
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:57,279
in the metropolitan area around Shanghai

655
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,600
and yet it's not really

656
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,799
crowded because right in front of us is

657
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,639
this iconic shot of the incredible

658
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:04,519
Skyline which I think because the

659
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,960
buildings over there are still in the

660
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
sunlight whereas we're in the shade my

661
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,840
eyes are having a hard time seeing it's

662
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,440
like perfectly lit up the lighting is so

663
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,519
trippy it's like it's it almost looks 2D

664
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,639
like if I reach out and touch it it just

665
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:18,760
be a flat painting but my point is the

666
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,000
uh entire area here

667
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,360
is pretty well organized and pretty nut

668
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
crowded for a place of 40 million it

669
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,159
just sounds like so many people I just I

670
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:27,519
just thought it would be

671
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,919
shoulder-to-shoulder everywhere you go

672
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,159
yes and I think most of them here are

673
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,639
tourists oh yeah yes this is like an

674
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:35,080
iconic tourist spot this would be one of

675
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,840
the first places you go at least for us

676
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,559
almost the first place we went and you

677
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,039
had tons of space to go around you can

678
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,559
get a photo against the railing and

679
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,679
there's nobody in your photo I mean it's

680
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,240
gorgeous my God quite nice like what I

681
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,399
can't believe I'm here you know so nice

682
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:54,039
I can't believe I'm

683
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,760
here so without further Ado let's eat

684
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,200
and I tell you what maybe one of the

685
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,840
reasons it's so clean and safe and

686
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,639
organized here there are these poles

687
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:07,720
with cameras on them all the way

688
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,399
down there's dozens and dozens of

689
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,639
cameras you can see all the way down

690
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:15,519
it's just uh almost like a security

691
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,000
camera almost like a camera that would

692
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
capture you if you're speeding through a

693
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,559
red light and they're all the way down

694
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,799
the whole walkway just kind of pointing

695
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,360
everywhere so I guess that uh keeps

696
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,399
crime low all the cameras know

697
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,480
I'll tell you what most people take

698
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,159
photos on this side for this view but I

699
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,440
find that both sides of this Boardwalk

700
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
is equally as interesting

701
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
wow look at

702
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,000
this very

703
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
cool yeah Ivana is right let's go a

704
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,679
journey down

705
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,000
here see if we can find a restaurant I'm

706
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,159
feeling like noodles you want to let's

707
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,039
find a noodle shop noodle soup or

708
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,799
something let's find it

709
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,679
I tell you what it's like I always say

710
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:05,320
the only bull Ivana takes is by the

711
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
horns is it me or the buildings look

712
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,320
bigger over here they are so big this is

713
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
look huge right

714
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,079
yeah Ivana and I are guessing a lot of

715
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,239
these buildings are going to be like the

716
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,079
courthouse or like the central bank or

717
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,159
like a lot of the old uh sort of

718
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,719
government buildings they just look

719
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,320
bigger than what we're familiar with you

720
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,480
know they're just

721
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,719
huge they're so imposing as you walk

722
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,959
down the

723
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,199
street I tell you what they say

724
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,800
everything's bigger in

725
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,679
Texas I think everything's bigger in

726
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,599
Shanghai

727
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,440
wow even bigger than

728
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,320
than and so I guess not only the cars

729
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,159
but also the scooters are quite off an

730
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,399
electric you can hear them going past

731
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,760
they're silent and they're just sort of

732
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,079
sneaking by and they seem to be Four

733
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,400
Seasons here in Beijing because they've

734
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,800
all got this uh type of almost like a

735
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,440
jacket that goes on the handlebars to

736
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,400
cover your wrists and hands and so I

737

sensation you have too many chilies but

862
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,720
my face is tingling right this is a this

863
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,599
a mysterious the TV here it's showing

864
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,880
how they make it look at the chili mean

865
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
it's all chili I wonder if this is going

866
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,839
to be a disaster it tastes good at least

867
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,359
but yeah it is good look at the chili

868
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,839
guys look at the

869
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,319
chili righted chili I never had an

870
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,920
experience is my face is going numb M's

871
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,200
good wow

872
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,280
interesting

873
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
sorry

874
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,640
can this a you

875
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,160
46 okay sh sh how

876
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,720
how all right so in

877
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,560
conclusion China is a place for me that

878
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,280
I think is the most intriguing country

879
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,839
youan and I could possibly come to

880
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,359
whether it's because of all of the

881
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,119
chinat towns we've been to whether it's

882
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,720
because Ivana herself is Chinese

883
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,079
Indonesian or growing up in Canada I had

884
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,319
so many Chinese friends cuz there are

885
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,880
millions of Chinese people there or

886
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,359
whether it's because of what the media

887
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:05,119
might say about big bad China sort of

888
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,839
all of these factors come together and I

889
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,640
was so intrigued and interested in

890
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,000
coming to China without even really

891
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,760
knowing what I expected and so I'm

892
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,400
really glad that our first day in

893
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,200
Shanghai was as interesting as I thought

894
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,880
it would be I guess I sort of expected

895
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,720
it would be part like Tokyo so amazing

896
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,839
and part like a Chinatown where there

897
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:28,240
people selling stuff everywhere and it's

898
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,200
all kind of broken but very lots of

899
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,240
character and very interesting and so in

900
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,000
the end Shanghai did not disappoint my

901
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,160
excitement and my Intrigue is still very

902
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,040
high and we've got lots more Shanghai

(FIRST TIME IN CHINA!) 🇨🇳,#China #Travel #TravelVlog #ChinaTravel #ChinaVisa ,"Welcome to our first video in China! In this video, we are going to be taking you on our stressful arrival in China, a country that our government told us not to visit. It's a big day for us, it us Americans first time in China! We start this vlog back in Manila, Philippines before heading to the airport to catch out Cebu Pacific flight to a mystery city in China. The stress of our first arrival in China came about through their new 144-hour visa program, which we decided to use. This visa had many weird rules and restrictions and with tons of research, we still weren't sure if our route applied. So we took our flight to find out. And to no ones surprise, there were issues. So join us on this late night (morning if you will) journey as we experience our first time in China, a country that the Americans government warns against travel. #China #Travel #TravelVlog #ChinaTravel #ChinaVisa Join this channel to get access to perks:    / @trifatelifestyle   If you want to send us any gifts, we have a PO Box!

A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales. We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why? Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life. It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown. The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us. Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land. Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must. It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so. We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.
